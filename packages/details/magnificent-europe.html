  Leaning Tower of Pisa
 After lunch you will transfer to Pisa. Here we view Leaning Tower of Pisa. Pisa is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its unintended tilt to one side. It is situated behind the Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square. The Pisa tower's tilt began during construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed, and gradually increased until the structure was stabilized by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Dinner and overnight stay at Hotel in Pisa , Italy.</p>                                        </div>
