It is best known for being the site of Shirakawa-gō, a small, traditional village showcasing a building style known as gasshō-zukuri and it is one of UNESCO&#39;s World Heritage Site. Here we visit the beautiful Ogimachi village. &nbsp;Ogimachi is a beautiful Village in Japan contained 152 households and here all the houses are very different, the roofs are made from thick layers of reed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Shirakawa-go is rather touristy, but it&rsquo;s definitely worth to visit.</p>

<p>On arrival in Shirakawagowe we hiked up to the viewpoint, strolled around the quaint little streets and along the small rice fields of Shirakawa-go village. You will get a chance to visit one more than 250 years old house in the village, Wada House. The Wada house is said to have been built in the mid-Edo period (1603-1868) and it also serves as a residence now. The lacquer ware and sericulture tools, manuscripts, etc. that were used in the Wada house are on display.The fireplace that is lit all year round is a great photo opportunity point, and you can also relax there. Here most of the farmhouses are separated from one another by plots of cultivated land and mostly constructed between the end of the Edo period and the end of the Meiji period. i.e. early 19th to early 20th century. All the ridges of these Gassho-style houses are aligned parallel to the Sho River, thus creating a unified and attractive village scene.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is one of Japan&rsquo;s most incredible sights.&nbsp;<br />
Later we transfer to Kyoto. After lunch we visit Arashiyama Bamboo forest. The Arashiyama Bamboo forest is one of Japan&rsquo;s most incredible sights. Located about 7km west of downtown Kyoto, Arashiyama is one of Kyoto&rsquo;s most popular sightseeing districts. The heart of the district is the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, a mesmerizing grove of thousands of tall bamboo plants. A paved walkway runs through the middle of both sections, forming the famous &ldquo;Bamboo Alley,&rdquo; one of Kyoto&rsquo;s most photographed sights. The combined length is about 500 meters, and the grove is about 140 meters wide. In the middle of the eastern section, near the main street, you&rsquo;ll find Nonomiya-jinja Shrine, a popular Shinto Shrine, while on the southern edge of the western section, you&rsquo;ll find the beautiful gardens and halls of Tenryu-ji Temple, one of Kyoto&rsquo;s most beautiful Buddhist temples. Many people wonder about the meaning or purpose of the bamboo grove. As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s merely decorative. Arashiyama has been a favorite location of imperial and noble villas and temples from the days of classical Japan.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later visit Togetsukyo Bridge. The Togetsukyo Bridge is Arashiyama&#39;s most iconic landmark. It was originally built during the Heian Period (794-1185) and most recently reconstructed in the 1930s. Built over Kyoto&rsquo;s former commerce center along the Oi River &ndash; which literally translates to &ldquo;Moon-Crossing Bridge&rdquo; &ndash; is Arashiyama&rsquo;s scenic landmark straight from a ukiyo-e painting. With a backdrop of fall foliage and full-blown cherry blossoms in the spring, this emblematic structure spans 155 meters &ndash; as if the wooden path would literally stretch to the moon. The poetic name was in fact inspired by the Emperor Kameyama, who witnessed a luminous moon rising above the upper reaches of the river, appearing as though the moon itself was crossing the bridge. Later we transfer to Kyoto. Dinner and overnight stay at Grand Prince Hotel or similar in Kyoto.</p></p>                                        </div>

In 1994, the temple was added to the list of UNESCO world heritage sites<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Later visit Nijo Castle, largest and best preserved castle in Kyoto. Nijo Castle or Nijo-jo was built as the residence of the first Tokugawa shogun of the Edo Period. The castle is surrounded by stone walls and moats. The castle is especially popular in Japanese history. The castle served as the shogunate&#39;s residence during his visits to Kyoto. The Ninomaru Palace is the main attraction of the castle. It is very well preserved, and has intricately decorated ceilings, elegantly painted sliding doors, tatami (bamboo mat) floors, and &quot;nightengale floors,&quot; which squeak when walked on. The purpose of those floors was to serve as an alert against intruders. The tour route guides visitors past many of the rooms in the castle, and different types of rooms used for different guests of the shogun are on display. Outside of the Ninomaru Palace is the Ninomaru Garden, which is a traditional Japanese garden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later we drive to Nara by coach. Nara is a spectacularly picturesque city which is second only to Kyoto for the richness and beauty of its temples, shrines and gardens. Here we visit Todaiji Temple &amp; Nara Park. Nara Park is a public park located in the city of Nara, Japan, at the foot of Mount Wakakusa. Established in 1880 it is one of the oldest parks in Japan.

<p>Osaka Castle and Park<br />
After lunch we transfer to osaka and after lunch we visit Osaka Castle and park. The Osaka Castle Park is just one of the many places in Japan that offers venue perfect for viewing picnics during hanami season. The 10-day deluge of cherry blossoms sets off a wave of delight among the locals, who celebrate the temperate weather and gorgeous sights with cherry blossom picnics. Osaka Castle, completed in 1586, was ordered built by famed Japanese warrior and politician Toyotomi Hideyoshi and was, at the time, the largest castle in Japan. Highlights include the five-story, 42-meter-tall main tower containing a great museum with exhibits related to the history of the castle and the city and it also offers superb views over Osaka from its upper floors. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Umeda Sky Building &ndash; Floating Garden</p>

<p>&nbsp;Later we visit the Umeda Sky Building, a stunning landmark consisting of two office towers joined at the top by a large platform-like structure. It&#39;s this rooftop structure that draws visitors, due largely to the network of bridges and an escalator, which join the two towers, providing plunging views of 170-plus meters that send shivers down the spines of those sensitive to heights. The views from the rooftop observatory and garden - aptly named the Floating Garden Observatory - are simply stunning. Afterwards, be sure to wander the urban garden at its base with its pleasant paths, fountains, and ponds, as well as a fun underground market designed to resemble early-20th century Osaka.

<p>After an buffet breakfast at hotel, check out and transfer to train station to take Bullet Train to Hiroshima . Hiroshima, a modern city on Japan&rsquo;s Honshu Island, was largely destroyed by an atomic bomb during World War II. On arrival you will see &nbsp;the historical highlights of Hiroshima on a comprehensive full-day tour, led by a knowledgeable guide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Here we visit Hiroshima Peace Park and Atomic Bomb Dome and feel emotionally stirred by the magnificent Hirsohima Peace Memorial Park and Museum, in which intriguing exhibitions speak eloquently of the atomic bomb dropped on the city in 1945. This building, which was once an exhibition hall, is the only structure near the explosion&rsquo;s center that survived in any capacity. The surviving skeleton has been maintained as it was left by the bombing, and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. This close to ground zero, it is miraculous that anything survived a blast that was equivalent to dropping 15,000 tons of TNT. &nbsp;The blast disintegrated everything within a one mile radius of its center, and caused destruction in a five mile area &ndash; essentially 2/3 of the city. The ruin of the hall serves as a memorial to the people who were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945. Over 70,000 people were killed instantly, and another 70,000 suffered fatal injuries from the radiation and we will see Genbaku Dome, one of the few buildings that was left standing near ground zero. Her we also visit the Hiroshima Memorial Peace Park. Before the war, this area was described as the lively shopping and entertainment center of Hiroshima. The park has many memorials, monuments and sculptures, but the centerpiece is the monument that covers a cenotaph inscribed with the names of all those that died from the nuclear bombing. Behind the cenotaph memorial is the Peace Flame which has burned continuously since 1964 and will not be extinguished until all threat of nuclear bombing has been eliminated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children&rsquo;s Peace Monument<br />
Her we visit the Children&rsquo;s Peace Monument. It was built with the contributions from 3200 Japanese schools and nine countries. At its base is a plaque that reads: &ldquo;This is our cry, this is our prayer: for building peace in this world&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br />
The monument is dedicated to all the children that died as a result of the bombing. The story behind the design of the Children&rsquo;s Peace Monument is even more touching. The sculpture is that of a girl holding a crane and is based on the real life story of Sadako Sasaki. Sadako was two years old when the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima and lived a little over one mile from ground zero. She and her parents survived the blast, but at the age of 12, she developed leukemia as a result of the radiation from the atomic bomb. In the hospital Sadako learned of the Japanese legend that promised that a wish would be granted to anyone that folded 1000 paper origami cranes. Her wish was for a world without nuclear weapons. One version of the story says that she only managed to make 644 paper cranes before she died on Oct. 12, 1955. &nbsp;The story goes on to say that her classmates went on to make 1000 paper cranes which were buried with her. Today, many come to this monument to donate paper cranes as a continuing symbol for the desire for peace.</p>
