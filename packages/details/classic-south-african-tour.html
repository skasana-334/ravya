<p>&nbsp;After continental breakfast you will take a boat cruise to Robben Island to see Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s prison. Robben Island-where most of Mandela&rsquo;s 27-year prison sentence was served - was a place of isolation for nearly 300 years, housing many political prisoners and serving as both a lunatic asylum and leper colony. In 1964, Nelson Mandela was arrested and brought to South Africa&rsquo;s Robben Island, just west of Cape Town. He would spend the next 18 years imprisoned in an 8x7-foot cell, forced to do hard labour, and permitted only one visitor a year. Even so, Mandela went on to become his country&rsquo;s first black president, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, and known globally for his significant contributions to human rights and social justice. Today, the island remains a tangible symbol of political freedom and a reminder of the difficult road to South African democracy. Here you&rsquo;ll be able to see human rights activist and former prisoner Robert Sobukwe&rsquo;s house; a 17th-century limestone quarry where Mandela and others were put to work; a leper colony cemetery; and the Robben Island Museum, dedicated to preserving the memory and contributions of the freedom fighters once held within its walls.</p>

<p>Cape Town City Tour</p>

<p>After lunch half day Cape Town City Tour. Cape Town is a port city on South Africa&rsquo;s southwest coast, on a peninsula beneath the imposing Table Mountain and it is the second-most populous urban area in South Africa after Johannesburg. &nbsp;Slowly rotating cable cars climb to the mountain&rsquo;s flat top, from which there are sweeping views of the city. In 2014, Cape Town was named the best place in the world to visit by both the American New York Times and the British Daily Telegraph. You will go for a scenic coastal drive through Clifton &amp; Sea Point &amp; later tour passes the Houses of Parliament, the Castle, the SA Museum, and a few other historical sights &ndash; District Six, Bo-Kaap, Slave Lodge &amp; ending at the bustling Greenmarket Square&hellip;..etc.</p>

<p>Seal Island Tour<br />
After the lunch we reach in Hout Bay for taking Seal Island Cruise. This destination, which sits halfway between Cape Town and Cape Point is a quiet fishing village that&rsquo;s home to dozens of seals, small shops and lots of local charm. &nbsp;Seal Island is a small land mass located 5.7 kilometers off the northern beaches of False Bay, near Cape Town, in South Africa. The island is so named because of the great number of Cape fur seals that occupy it. It is 5 acres in area and home to 64,000 cape fur seals and home to seabirds too and it is likely that non-marine species fly there to breed as well. A radar mast was built on the island during World War II. The dense population of seals at certain times of the year attracts the seal&#39;s main predator, the great white shark. Seal Island and the adjacent waters provide rare opportunities for those who wish to witness attacks by great whites on the Cape fur seal and to observe social interactions amongst creatures of both species.</p>

<p>Penguin Colony visit</p>

<p>Evening we visit the beautiful Boulders Beach, and have the option to sit among the famous colony of Jackass Penguins. &nbsp;Boulders Beach forms part of the Table Mountain National Park and it is a popular tourist stop because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. Enjoy your time in Boulders beach. Overnight stay at hotel.</p>

He left an account of the disaster hidden in an old shoe which he suspended from a milkwood tree near the spring from which explorer Bartolomeu Dias had drawn water. The report was found by the explorer to whom it was addressed, Jo&atilde;o da Nova, and the tree served as a kind post office for decades thereafter. More recently, a boot-shaped post box has been erected under the now famous tree, and letters posted there are franked with a commemorative stamp. This has ensured that the tree has remained one of the town&rsquo;s biggest tourist attractions. &nbsp;Later you proceed to Oudtshoorn.

<p>Visit Satyagraha House of Mahatma Gandhi</p>

<p>On arrival and after Monati (lunch) we visit Satyagraha House, commonly known as Gandhi House, is a museum and guest house located in Johannesburg. This house, in the residential neighborhood of Orchards in Johannesburg, was the home of Mohandas Gandhi from 1908. This house contains many of Gandhi&rsquo;s sayings, pictures, stories, and the furnishings he used. Within these walls, the future Mahatma created and developed his philosophy of passive resistance &lsquo;Satyagraha&rsquo; in Sanskrit. A pacifist method of protest that he employed in India to lead the country to independence. The house was built in 1907 by Gandhi&rsquo;s close friend, the German architect Hermann Kallenbach. The Satyagraha House is now a registered part of the country&rsquo;s historical heritage. This museum retracing Gandhi&rsquo;s experiences in South Africa and particularly those that he shared here with his friend Kallenbach is installed in the very heart of the house. In this way, a peaceful and meditative atmosphere channeling Gandhi&rsquo;s life within these walls inhabits the property. Later you will have an orientation tour of Johannesburg and will visit Constitution Hill, Johannesburg Art Gallery, the Hill brow skyline at night, Nelson Mandela Square...etc. (If time permits). Later we transfer to Pretoria. Dinner and overnight stay in Hotel at Pretoria.</p>

<p>Kruger is one of the world&#39;s greatest wildlife-watching destinations. Its high density of wild animals includes the Big 5: lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalos. Hundreds of other mammals make their home here, as do diverse bird species such as vultures, eagles and storks. Mountains, bush plains and tropical forests are all part of the landscape. One of South Africa&rsquo;s most popular tourist destinations, the Kruger National Park is famous the world over. &nbsp;It is the oldest Park in Africa and also one of the largest. Kruger National Park was established in 1898 and in 1926, the Kruger National Park merged with Shingwedzi Game Reserve, creating South Africa&rsquo;s very first national park. More recently, the Kruger became part of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park, an international collaboration that joins the park with Limpopo National Park in Mozambique and Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe. As a result, animals can now move freely across international borders as they would have done thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Early morning you will drive to Kruger Natural Reserve Park in an open vehicle for a full day game drive (African Safari). The full day game drive is the perfect chance to relax and be guided on your wildlife experience. Kruger offers a unique ecosystem with the Kalahari that meets the bushveld. This allow for a variety of trees and grasses that offers a great habitat in return. The Birdlife and raptors are especially interesting not to mention the variety of mammals and reptiles that can be found in the park. The vehicles allow for excellent photography opportunities. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You will get a chance to see the magnificent animals Africa&#39;s &#39;Big Five&#39;the lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros, and buffalo in Kruger. In central Kruger, you&rsquo;ll find expanses of open savannah, home to impala, zebra, wildebeest, kudus, giraffes and elephants. This is also the best place to see big cats, as leopards and lions are common, and cheetahs are more likely to be seen here than anywhere else in the park. Now It&#39;s one of the largest and most-popular game reserves on the continent, annually drawing half a million visitors who are lured by the park&#39;s truly spectacular scenery, well-managed infrastructure and high density of exotic wildlife.Later return back to Lodge. Dinner and Overnight stay at Safari Camp at Kruger.</p>
